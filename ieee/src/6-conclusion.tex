\section{Conclusion}
We proposed a new transfer learning approach for building performance prediction models of DBMS.
Our proposed method is based on the observation that parameters can be divided into two groups: the parameters that have similar effects across different hardware environment and the parameters that do not.
We adopted a novel parameter separation technique which allowed us to employ different transfer learning methods for each group of parameters.
Our experimental results show that our proposed method requires less than half the amount of training data that the existing methods require to achieve the same prediction accuracy.
